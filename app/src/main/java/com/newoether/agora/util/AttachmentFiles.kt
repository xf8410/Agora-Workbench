/**
 * Single home for deleting the app-private files that back a [SelectedAttachment], so the composer
 * (removing a picked attachment) and the generation layer (dropping a queued send that was never
 * sent) don't duplicate — and drift on — the same delete logic.
 *
 * Ownership rule: these files are private copies the composer made at pick time. They stay alive
 * only while a [SelectedAttachment] still references them. Once an attachment's message is stored
 * the files belong to the [com.newoether.agora.data.local.MessageEntity] (message deletion cleans
 * them up) — so callers must NOT call this on an attachment whose send actually went through; only
 * on abandoned ones (X-removed picks, X-removed / cleared queued sends).
 *
 * Never touches the original content:// [SelectedAttachment.uri] — that isn't ours to delete.
